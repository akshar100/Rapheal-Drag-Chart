First include rapheal.js and then include graph.js

USAGE::
var graph = new Rg({
				container:document.getElementById("canvas_container"),
				x:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
				y:[1,2,3,4],
				snap:true
			}); 
			graph.render();

It automatically claculates the height based on the datapoitns submitted. 
You can also specifiy "dotsize" and "separator" which are respectively the radius and separation between datapoints.
