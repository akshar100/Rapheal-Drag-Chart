First include rapheal.js and then include graph.js

USAGE::
var graph = new Rg({
				container:document.getElementById("canvas_container"),
				x:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
				y:[1,2,3,4],
				snap:true
			}); 
			graph.render();

It automatically claculates the height based on the datapoitns submitted. 
You can also specifiy "dotsize" and "separator" which are respectively the radius and separation between datapoints. 

To obtain the data points once user drags the the datapoints call

graph.getPoints();

points are automatically normalized to the the y scale provided in the contructor.
